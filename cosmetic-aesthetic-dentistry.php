					<!--<p>Dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.</p>-->
					<p>Dentistry is no longer just a case of filling and taking out teeth. Nowadays many people turn to cosmetic dentistry, or â€˜aesthetic dentistry', as a way of improving their appearance.</p>
				<h4>Types :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Inlays and Onlays : These are also known as indirect fillings, which are made by a dental laboratory, and they are used when a tooth has mild to moderate decay or there is not enough tooth structure to support a filling. Provided there is no damage to the tooth cusps, according to Choice One Dental Care, the inlay is placed directly onto the tooth surface. When the cusp or a greater portion of the tooth is damaged, however, an onlay is used instead to cover the tooth's entire surface.</li>
					<li>Composite Bonding : Composite bonding refers to the repair of decayed, damaged or discolored teeth using material that resembles the color of tooth enamel. Your dentist drills out the tooth decay and applies the composite onto the tooth's surface, then "sculpts" it into the right shape before curing it with a high-intensity light. Also referred to as simply "bonding," per the Consumer Guide to Dentistry, this effectively covers the damage to the tooth and gives the appearance of a healthy tooth in its place. Bonding is one of the least expensive cosmetic dentistry procedures available to patients with tooth decay, chipped or cracked teeth and worn-down edges.</li>
					<li>Dental Veneers : Typically manufactured from medical-grade ceramic, dental veneers are made individually for each patient to resemble one's natural teeth, according to Bruce Wilderman, DDS. They look exceptionally realistic and can resolve numerous cosmetic problems, ranging from crooked teeth, to cracked or damaged enamel to noticeable gaps between two teeth. The dentist applies the veneer to the front of each tooth using a dental adhesive.</li>
					<li>Teeth Whitening : One of the most basic cosmetic dentistry procedures, teeth whitening or teeth bleaching can be performed at your dentist's office. Whitening should occur after plaque, tartar and other debris are cleaned from the surface of each tooth, restoring their natural appearance. </li>
					<li>Implants : Dental implants are used to replace teeth after tooth loss. The dentist inserts a small titanium screw into the jaw at the site of the missing tooth, which serves as the support for a crown. These implants are almost indistinguishable from the surrounding natural teeth, and once the bone and supporting tissue fuse to the implant, they are permanently secured into place. </li>					
				</ul>
				<h4>Procedure :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Dental Bonding: The application of tooth-colored composite to the teeth. The bonding material can then be polished and shaped to look like the rest of the teeth.</li>
					<li>Gum Contouring: Do you have a gummy smile or uneven gum line? Gum contouring treatments can reshape your gum line to produce a more beautiful smile.</li>
					<li>Porcelain Veneers: Ceramic shells applied to the front of the teeth to conceal cracks and chips, overlay gaps, and create a whiter appearance to a person's smile.</li>
					<li>Teeth Whitening: There are two methods for whitening teeth: laser teeth whitening (performed in the cosmetic dentist's office) and at-home teeth bleaching (involving the use of take-home bleaching kits).</li>
