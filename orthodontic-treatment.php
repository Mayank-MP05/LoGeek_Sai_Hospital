					<!--<p>Dental implants are replacement tooth roots. Implants provide a strong foundation for fixed (permanent) or removable replacement teeth that are made to match your natural teeth.</p>-->
					<p>Orthodontic treatment is a way of straightening or moving teeth, to improve the appearance of the teeth and how they work. It can also help to look after the long-term health of your teeth, gums and jaw joints, by spreading the biting pressure over all your teeth.</p>
				<h4>Symptoms :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Crowding – when there is not quite enough room in the jaw for the size of the teeth and the teeth are turned, tipped or at strange angles in the mouth. This can happen anywhere in the mouth but is most often seen at the front. This often worsens with age.</li>
					<li>Spacing – this may be due to missing teeth or may happen if the teeth and jaw sizes don’t quite match. The gap might be in one place only or gaps might appear between many teeth.</li>
					<li>Overbite – or “buck teeth” where the top front teeth appear to stick out too far forward of the lower teeth. Dentists and orthodontists call this an excessive overjet.</li>
					<li>Underbite – here the upper front teeth appear to bite directly on top of or behind the lower teeth. The dental term for this is a reverse overjet.</li>
					<li>Deep bite – the top front teeth cover more than a couple of millimetres of the lower front teeth so that not much, if any, of the lower front teeth can be seen when the back teeth are together.</li>
					<li>Open bite – when there is a gap between the biting part of some of the upper and lower teeth when the back teeth are together.</li>
					<li>Cross bite – when some of the upper teeth bite down on the wrong side of the lower teeth when the back teeth are together. This can be at the front or at the back.</li>

				</ul>
				<h4>Procedure :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The first step includes documentation of your medical and dental histories, and evaluation and explanation of your recommended treatment, and a discussion about your payment and financial arrangements.</li>
					<li>In the second step, the orthodontist uses 3-D imaging and photos to be included in your diagnostic records. Spacers may also be placed between the teeth in this step to make room for future orthodontic bands.</li>
					<li>The third step is pretty exciting! This is when the orthodontist actually places the braces on your teeth. The bands, brackets, and wires are all fitted to the teeth. Patients who have opted for Invisalign will receive the first set of aligners.</li>
					<li>The fourth step is also called the active phase of orthodontic treatment. The orthodontist is actively moving the teeth into their ideal positions, and you will have a series of ‘checkup’ appointments so that your progress can be monitored. These appointments typically take place every 6-8 weeks, with adjustments and elastics as needed.</li>
					<li>In the fifth step, once the orthodontist has achieved the perfect bite relationship, the braces can be taken off. The length of time between step 3 and step 5 can vary, depending on the severity of your particular case, but can average between 12 months and 24 months. It is also common to have a retainer placed on the teeth on the same day.</li>
					<li>The orthodontist will advise you on how and when to wear your retainer, and you’ll need a few periodic appointments for checkups in this sixth and final phase of your orthodontic journey.</li>
